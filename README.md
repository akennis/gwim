# gwim

**Windows-native Kerberos/NTLM authentication and TLS for Go HTTP servers.**

Deploying a Go service inside a corporate Active Directory domain normally means standing up IIS or a reverse proxy just to get Windows integrated authentication, authorization, and TLS. `gwim` removes that requirement. It wraps any `http.Handler` with Windows-native Kerberos authentication, enriches the request context with LDAP group memberships, and pulls TLS certificates straight from the Windows certificate store — letting you ship a single self-contained web server `.exe` that runs seamlessly in a Windows domain environment. With `gwim`, you can run Go websites securely right where your users are and just how your Windows infrastructure is configured.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Needed for |
|---|---|
| Windows OS | All features (library uses Windows SSPI / CryptoAPI) |
| Active Directory domain membership | Kerberos authentication |
| A registered SPN for the server host (e.g. `HTTP/myserver.corp.local`) | Kerberos authentication |
| A certificate imported into the Windows certificate store | `GetWin32Cert` / `GetCertificateFunc` |
| LDAP-reachable domain controller + a service account SPN | `NewLDAPProvider` |

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/akennis/gwim
```

## Quick Start

The snippet below is the smallest possible secure server using `gwim`. It retrieves a TLS certificate from the Windows certificate store, wraps a handler with Kerberos authentication, and starts listening. Error handling is omitted for brevity.

```go
package main

import (
    "crypto/tls"
    "log"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/akennis/gwim"
)

func main() {
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        username, _ := gwim.User(r)
        w.Write([]byte("Hello, " + username))
    })

    // Create a Kerberos authentication provider
    sspiProvider, _ := gwim.NewSSPIProvider()

    // Retrieve a TLS certificate from the Windows certificate store
    certSource, _ := gwim.GetWin32Cert("myserver.corp.local", gwim.CertStoreLocalMachine)
    defer certSource.Close()

    srv := &http.Server{
        Addr:    ":8443",
        Handler: sspiProvider.Middleware(mux),
        TLSConfig: &tls.Config{
            Certificates: []tls.Certificate{certSource.Certificate},
        },
    }

    // Windows authenticates the current domain user transparently —
    // no login prompt, no credentials to manage.
    log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServeTLS("", ""))
}
```

## How It Works

Requests flow through the middleware chain in the following order:

```
Client Request
  │
  ▼
SSPI Middleware (Kerberos or NTLM negotiation)
  │  ── sets the authenticated username in the request context
  ▼
LDAP Middleware (optional)
  │  ── looks up the user's group memberships and adds them to the context
  ▼
Your Application Handler
  │  ── reads username via gwim.User(r)
  │  ── reads groups  via gwim.UserGroups(r)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Refer to your server framework's documentation for instructions on how to apply middleware in the correct order.  Some frameworks (such has the standard net/http framework) require middleware to be applied in reverse order (i.e. LDAP applied before SSPI), while other frameworks require middleware to be applied in the order of actual request flow (i.e. SSPI applied before LDAP).**

## Usage Examples

See the [examples](examples) directory for complete, runnable servers:

- [**Minimal secure server**](examples/min-win-server/main.go) — TLS + Kerberos/NTLM authentication with optional LDAP group lookup, in under 200 lines.
- [**Session-enabled secure server**](examples/sec-win-server/main.go) — adds session management and caching so that authentication and LDAP lookups happen once per session rather than on every request, with graceful shutdown and zero-downtime certificate rotation.

## API

### Authentication

`gwim` uses the **Middleware Factory Pattern**: create a provider once at startup, then register its `.Middleware` method with any router's `Use()` call or use it to wrap handlers manually. The `.Middleware` method satisfies the standard `func(http.Handler) http.Handler` signature, making it compatible with `net/http`, Gorilla Mux, Chi, and adapter-compatible with Gin, Echo, and Fiber.

#### `NewSSPIProvider`

```go
sspiProvider, err := gwim.NewSSPIProvider(opts ...SSPIOption) (*SSPIProvider, error)
```

Acquires Windows SSPI credentials and returns a provider. Any credential acquisition error is surfaced here at startup rather than on the first request.

```go
// Kerberos (production default)
sspiProvider, err := gwim.NewSSPIProvider()

// NTLM (local / non-domain development)
sspiProvider, err := gwim.NewSSPIProvider(gwim.WithNTLM())

// With custom error handling
sspiProvider, err := gwim.NewSSPIProvider(
    gwim.WithNTLM(),
    gwim.WithSSPIErrorHandlers(gwim.AuthErrorHandlers{
        OnGeneralError: myErrorHandler,
    }),
)
```

Use the provider:

```go
// Standard net/http
handler := sspiProvider.Middleware(mux)

// Any router with Use()
router.Use(sspiProvider.Middleware)
```

**SSPIOption functions:**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `WithNTLM()` | Use NTLM instead of Kerberos. Required for non-domain or localhost scenarios. |
| `WithSSPIErrorHandlers(h AuthErrorHandlers)` | Override default error responses. |

> [!NOTE]
> **Kerberos should be used in production** as it is significantly more secure. NTLM support is included only to facilitate local development where the developer is hitting the server from a browser on the same host (a scenario where Kerberos loopback authentication does not work).

#### `ConfigureNTLM`

```go
gwim.ConfigureNTLM(server *http.Server)
```

Configures the `http.Server` with the `ConnContext` callback required for NTLM connection tracking. NTLM is connection-oriented — each TCP connection carries its own authentication state. This function assigns a unique ID to every connection so the NTLM handler can correlate the two-step token exchange across requests on the same keep-alive connection. **Only required when using NTLM; not needed for Kerberos.**

### LDAP Group Authorization

#### `NewLDAPProvider`

```go
ldapProvider, err := gwim.NewLDAPProvider(opts ...LDAPOption) (*LDAPProvider, error)
```

Returns a provider that enriches an authenticated request's context with the user's Active Directory group memberships (transitively, via the `tokenGroups` attribute). Groups are returned as LDAP Distinguished Names (DNs), e.g. `CN=AppAdmins,OU=Groups,DC=corp,DC=local`.

**Startup validation:** `NewLDAPProvider` performs a synchronous connectivity check before returning. It opens a TLS (LDAPS) connection to the configured address, authenticates via GSSAPI/Kerberos bind using the server's current-user credentials, and executes a RootDSE search. If any step fails, an error is returned here at startup rather than on the first request.

At runtime, the provider maintains an internal connection pool (capacity: 10). On each request a pooled connection is health-checked with a lightweight RootDSE probe before use; connections that fail the probe or exceed their TTL are discarded and a new one is created.

```go
ldapProvider, err := gwim.NewLDAPProvider(
    gwim.WithLDAPAddress("dc01.corp.local:636"),
    gwim.WithLDAPUsersDN("OU=Users,DC=corp,DC=local"),
    gwim.WithLDAPServiceAccountSPN("HTTP/myserver.corp.local"),
)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to create LDAP provider: %v", err)
}

// Wrap the SSPI-wrapped handler
handler = ldapProvider.Middleware(sspiProvider.Middleware(mux))

// Or with a router
router.Use(ldapProvider.Middleware)
router.Use(sspiProvider.Middleware)
```

**LDAPOption functions:**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `WithLDAPAddress(addr string)` | Host and port of the LDAP / domain controller (LDAPS is always used) |
| `WithLDAPUsersDN(dn string)` | Distinguished Name of the OU containing user accounts |
| `WithLDAPServiceAccountSPN(spn string)` | SPN of the LDAP service account used for GSSAPI bind |
| `WithLDAPTimeout(d time.Duration)` | Per-operation timeout; defaults to `DefaultLdapTimeout` (5s) |
| `WithLDAPConnectionTTL(d time.Duration)` | Max lifetime of a pooled connection; defaults to `DefaultLdapTTL` (1h) |
| `WithLDAPErrorHandlers(h AuthErrorHandlers)` | Override default error responses |

### Framework Adapters

The `.Middleware` method returns the standard `func(http.Handler) http.Handler` signature supported directly by most routers:

```go
// Gin
router.Use(gin.WrapH(sspiProvider.Middleware(http.DefaultServeMux)))

// Echo
e.Use(echo.WrapMiddleware(sspiProvider.Middleware))
```

### Request Context Helpers

- `User(r *http.Request) (string, bool)` — Returns the authenticated username from the request context.
- `SetUser(r *http.Request, username string) *http.Request` — Injects a username into the request context. If a username is already present when the SSPI middleware runs, authentication is skipped — use this to restore a session without re-running SSPI.
- `UserGroups(r *http.Request) ([]string, bool)` — Returns the user's group memberships from the request context as LDAP Distinguished Names (DNs), e.g. `CN=AppAdmins,OU=Groups,DC=corp,DC=local`.
- `SetUserGroups(r *http.Request, groups []string) *http.Request` — Injects group memberships into the request context. If groups are already present when the LDAP middleware runs, the LDAP lookup is skipped — use this to restore cached groups from a session.

Use `SetUser` and `SetUserGroups` together to restore a previously authenticated identity from a session store, avoiding re-authentication and LDAP lookups on every request:

```go
// In your session middleware, before the SSPI middleware runs:
if sessionUser, ok := getSession(r); ok {
    r = gwim.SetUser(r, sessionUser)
    r = gwim.SetUserGroups(r, sessionUser.Groups)
}
```

See [sec-win-server/main.go](examples/sec-win-server/main.go) for a full working example of this pattern.

### TLS Certificate

- `GetWin32Cert(certSubject string, store CertStore) (*CertificateSource, error)` — Retrieves a TLS certificate from the Windows certificate store by Common Name. Use `CertStoreLocalMachine` or `CertStoreCurrentUser` for `store`. The certificate is validated before being returned: it must not be expired, must carry `ExtKeyUsageServerAuth`, and its full issuer chain must pass verification via the Windows CryptoAPI. The returned `CertificateSource.Certificate` is a `tls.Certificate` ready for use in `tls.Config.Certificates`. Call `Close()` on the source when it is no longer needed (e.g. on server shutdown) to release Windows store handles.

- `GetCertificateFunc(certSubject string, store CertStore, refreshThreshold, retryInterval time.Duration) (func(*tls.ClientHelloInfo) (*tls.Certificate, error), io.Closer, error)` — Like `GetWin32Cert` but returns a `tls.Config.GetCertificate` callback that transparently refreshes the certificate in the background when it is within `refreshThreshold` of expiry, enabling zero-downtime rotation. Pass `DefaultRefreshThreshold` and `DefaultRetryInterval` for standard values. Call `Close()` on the returned `io.Closer` after `http.Server.Shutdown` returns.

### Error Handling (`AuthErrorHandlers`)

Both `WithSSPIErrorHandlers` and `WithLDAPErrorHandlers` accept an `AuthErrorHandlers` struct to customize error responses. Each field is an `AuthErrorHandler func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, err error)`:

| Field | Triggered when… |
|---|---|
| `OnUnauthorized` | The `Authorization` header is missing or invalid |
| `OnInvalidToken` | The base64 token from the client is malformed |
| `OnAuthFailed` | An error occurs during the SSPI/GSSAPI token exchange |
| `OnIdentityError` | The username cannot be retrieved after successful auth |
| `OnLdapConnectionError` | A connection to the LDAP server cannot be established |
| `OnLdapLookupError` | An error occurs during an LDAP search or lookup |
| `OnGeneralError` | Catch-all: fills in for any of the above handlers that is not explicitly set |

If no options are provided, sensible defaults are used (plain-text HTTP error responses).

Requests do not progress to the next request hander in the chain once an error has occurred.  The error handler is executed and control is sent back up the request hander chain (i.e. the earlier handlers).

## Integration Testing

The `integration_tests` package contains client/server tests for both NTLM and Kerberos authentication.

### Running NTLM Tests

NTLM tests can be run locally by spawning the test server and the test runner on the same machine.

1.  Build the test server:
    ```powershell
    go build -o testserver.exe ./integration_tests/cmd/testserver/main.go
    ```
2.  Run the test server:
    ```powershell
    .\testserver.exe --addr 127.0.0.1:8080 --use-ntlm=true
    ```
3.  Run the tests:
    ```powershell
    go test -tags=integration -v ./integration_tests -server-url http://127.0.0.1:8080 -auth-mode ntlm
    ```

### Running Kerberos Tests

Kerberos tests require the test server and the test runner to be on **separate machines** within the same Active Directory domain. This is because Windows handles local Kerberos authentication (loopback) differently than remote authentication.

1.  Deploy and run `testserver.exe` on Machine A (the "server").
2.  Run the tests from Machine B (the "client") pointing to Machine A:
    ```powershell
    go test -tags=integration -v ./integration_tests -server-url http://<machine-a-hostname>:8080 -auth-mode kerberos
    ```

## Code Coverage

`gwim` supports code coverage collection for out-of-process integration tests using Go 1.22's `-cover` instrumentation.

1.  Build an instrumented test server:
    ```powershell
    go build -cover -o testserver.exe ./integration_tests/cmd/testserver/main.go
    ```
2.  Run the server with `GOCOVERDIR` set to an output directory:
    ```powershell
    mkdir coverage_data
    $env:GOCOVERDIR="coverage_data"
    .\testserver.exe --addr 127.0.0.1:8080 --use-ntlm=true
    ```
3.  Run your integration tests as usual.
4.  Stop the server (Ctrl+C). The server will gracefully shut down and flush coverage data to the `coverage_data` directory.
5.  View the coverage percentage:
    ```powershell
    go tool covdata percent -i=coverage_data
    ```
6.  Generate an HTML report:
    ```powershell
    go tool covdata textfmt -i=coverage_data -o coverage.out
    go tool cover '-html=coverage.out'
    ```
